I'm a **Software Engineer** with **15+ years of experience** building and scaling software while helping teams deliver meaningful business outcomes. My focus today is on leading and mentoring engineers, shaping robust architectures, and improving developer experience so teams can move fast without sacrificing quality.

#### **Leadership and Delivery**
I have led cross-functional teams and partnered with product and stakeholders to ship on time and within budget. I care about strong execution habits: clear priorities, lightweight rituals, and practical documentation. I have worked on onboarding and team enablement, quality standards, and feedback loops that improve delivery, reliability, and morale.

#### **Architecture and Engineering**
I design modular, event-driven systems and put observability first (metrics, tracing, logging) to keep systems healthy in production. I enjoy building infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD pipelines that make releases predictable, and I invest in testing (unit + e2e) to protect quality over time. My primary stack is **TypeScript/Node.js** (NestJS), **React**, and **SQL**, with a strong background in cloud platforms and modern developer tooling.

#### **Open Source and Communities**
I am involved in open-source initiatives and developer communities, where I contribute to long-term projects, mentor contributors, and advocate for sustainable engineering practices.

Outside of work, I enjoy travel, photography, and exploring new technology.
