I'm a **Software Engineer** with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology.
**I've %yearOfExperience% years of experience in software development and I usually spend most of my time exploring, making research and working in this field**. My current focus is on leading, organizing, coaching people, designing software architectures, and providing top-notch developer experience using cutting-edge technologies to deliver the best business value.

#### **As a Manager and Leader** 
I've led many engineers and communicated with product managers and stakeholders to deliver projects on time and within budget. I'm always eager to assist my colleagues helping them to make the right technical decisions and working closely with them to speed up the tasks or unblock any impediment. I've worked a lot on optimizing the onboarding process, the developer experience, and the KPI goals such as team productivity, quality control and skill matrix. So far, I've been using the AGILE Framework by acting as a Scrum Master, coordinating retrospectives, introducing workflow gamification, and optimizing the meetings to keep the team focus and the motivation as high as possible. I'm also currently involved as the founder, lead developer, and administrator of various **open-source** and non-profit communities with thousands of active users such as [AzerothCore](http://azerothcore.org)


#### **As a Software Engineer and Architect**
I've been responsible for the development of modular software architectures by:

* Desigining the model of the architecture by using the Domain-driven approach
* Defining the structure of the code by using the most suitable patterns and principles based on the technical needs.
* Writing unit tests with 100% coverage threshold, e2e tests, and documentation.
* Using cloud solutions such as GCP, AWS, Proxmox and self-hosted software such as Sentry, ArgoCD, Grafana etc.
* Orchestrating containers remotely and locally with Kubernetes and docker-compose
* Streaming events between services with Kafka, Google Pubsub, AWS SQS
* Doing the off-the-shelf for a new project since I've worked in both the frontend and the backend with different kinds of languages including Typescript, PHP, Java, C++ etc. Also, I worked with many very known libraries and frameworks such as NestJS, NextJS, React, VueJS, Angular, Symfony, Laravel, Lumen, Boost etc.
* Storing data on different DBMS such as MySQL (that I master), MongoDB, SQLLite, Redis and Firebase.

I love to produce high-quality software and **I always look for perfect, effective and practical solutions to any potential problem.**


#### **A bit of my history**

I've started my career with **Pascal, TCL, **C++, **and **MySQL** with which I've learned the basics of programming languages, database administration and software architecture.  I wrote my **first desktop **and server applications** for enterprises and big open source organizations in **%startYear%**.  
Later on, I enrolled at the **University of **Computer Science to improve my software engineering skills where I also learned more about UX, Java, and design patterns**. During this time, I've been working on many enterprise projects based on Languages such as Typescript, PHP and Java 
by using the best design patterns. 
I had an experience as the **Manager** of my personal organizations ([Hyperweb2](http://www.hyperweb2.com/), [Drassil](http://www.drassil.org/)).  
I've organized [15 days of seminars](https://www.facebook.com/pg/redsquarelab/photos/?ref=page_internal) about **ReactJS and NodeJS**, with which I've created a team of 6 freelancers, the [Red Square team](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fview%2Fredsquarelab/). We've worked on various enterprise projects for which I played the role of both PM and Lead Developer.
Nowadays instead, I'm working for an international company in The Netherlands to move up in my career in this challenging and amazing environment.


Besides my job, I love to travel, taking pictures, and learn as much as I can.
